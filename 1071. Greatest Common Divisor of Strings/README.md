**Approach:**

The given problem aims to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings `str1` and `str2`. To solve this problem, we iterate through the lengths of both strings starting from the minimum of their lengths. For each length `i`, we check if both `l1` and `l2` are divisible by `i`. If they are, we calculate the repetition factors `r1` and `r2` for `str1` and `str2` respectively. Then, we concatenate substrings of length `i` from `str1` and `str2` `r1` and `r2` times, and compare them with the original strings. If they match, we return the substring of length `i` as the GCD.

**Intuition:**

The idea behind this approach is to iterate through the possible lengths of the common divisors of both strings, starting from the maximum possible length and gradually decreasing until we find a common divisor. Once we find a common divisor, we check if it satisfies the condition of being the GCD by comparing the concatenated substrings with the original strings.

**Time Complexity:**

Let `n` be the length of the shorter string between `str1` and `str2`. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) due to the nested loop where we iterate over all possible lengths of the common divisors and concatenate substrings `r1` and `r2` times.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of this approach is O(n) where `n` is the length of the shorter string between `str1` and `str2`. This is because we store the concatenated substrings `result1` and `result2`, each of length `n`, in memory during the iteration.
