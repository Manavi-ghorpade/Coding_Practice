### Intuition:
The problem involves adding two numbers represented as linked lists, where each node represents a digit. We need to perform the addition digit by digit, considering the carry.

### Approach:
1. Traverse both linked lists simultaneously, pushing each digit onto separate stacks.
2. Pop elements from both stacks, add them along with the carry from the previous step, and update the carry for the next iteration.
3. Create a new node for the result, set its value to the sum % 10, and update the result linked list.
4. Move the result pointer to the newly created node.
5. Continue this process until both stacks are empty and there's no carry left.
6. Return the head of the result linked list.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists. We traverse both linked lists once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists. We use two stacks to store the digits of each linked list.
