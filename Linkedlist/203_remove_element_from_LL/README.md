### Intuition:
The code aims to remove all nodes with a specific value (`val`) from a given linked list.

### Approach:
1. A dummy node is used to handle cases where the head itself needs to be removed.
2. Traverse the linked list using `curr`.
3. If the value of the current node (`curr->val`) matches the target value (`val`), update the previous node's next pointer to skip the current node.
4. Move the `prev` pointer accordingly.
5. Continue until the end of the linked list is reached.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm traverses the entire linked list once.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are used; the algorithm uses only a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
