**Intuition:**
The goal is to reverse a subsequence of a linked list between indices `left` and `right`. To achieve this, we need to keep track of the nodes before and after the subsequence. We can use a dummy node to simplify edge cases. The intuition is to traverse the list until we reach the node at index `left`, reverse the subsequence, and then reconnect the reversed part back to the original list.

**Approach:**
1. Create a dummy node and set it as the new head of the list. This simplifies the case when `left` is at the beginning of the list.
2. Traverse the list until reaching the node at index `left`. Keep track of the node before the subsequence (`before_list`).
3. Reverse the subsequence between indices `left` and `right`.
4. Reconnect the reversed subsequence back to the original list.

**Time Complexity:**
The algorithm involves a single pass through the linked list, so the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the list.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
