**Intuition:**
The goal is to convert a sorted linked list into a balanced binary search tree (BST). The intuition is to find the middle of the linked list to use as the root of the BST, then recursively build the left and right subtrees using the left and right parts of the linked list.

**Approach:**
1. Use the two-pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Create a new TreeNode with the value of the middle node.
3. Disconnect the left part of the linked list to create a valid left subtree.
4. Recursively build the left and right subtrees by calling the function on the left and right parts of the linked list.
5. Return the root of the binary search tree.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(N log N) due to the recursive calls, where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(log N) for the recursion stack, where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
