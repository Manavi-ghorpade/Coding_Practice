**Intuition:**
The goal is to detect and find the starting point of a cycle in a linked list. The intuition is to use two pointers â€“ a slow pointer that moves one step at a time and a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet.

**Approach:**
1. Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, initially set to the head of the linked list.
2. In the first pass, move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, they will eventually meet.
3. If there is no cycle (fast pointer reaches the end), return `nullptr`.
4. Reset `slow` to the head and move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the start of the cycle.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because, in the worst case, both pointers traverse the entire linked list.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
