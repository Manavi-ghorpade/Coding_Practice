**Intuition:**
The goal is to convert a binary linked list to its decimal equivalent. The intuition is to traverse the linked list twice â€“ first to calculate its length and then to convert the binary representation to decimal.

**Approach:**
1. **First pass:** Traverse the linked list to calculate its length.
2. **Second pass:** Traverse the linked list again, updating the decimal result based on the binary-to-decimal conversion.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm involves two passes through the linked list.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
