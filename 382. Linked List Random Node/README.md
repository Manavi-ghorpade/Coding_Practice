**Intuition:**
The goal of this solution is to create an object that can efficiently return a random value from a given linked list. The random value should be uniformly selected from the elements of the linked list.

**Approach:**
1. In the constructor (`Solution`), iterate through the linked list to find its length and store the starting node.
2. In the `getRandom` function, generate a random index within the range [0, length - 1].
3. Traverse the linked list to the node at the randomly generated index and return its value.

**Time Complexity:**
- Constructor: O(n), where n is the length of the linked list. This is because the constructor iterates through the entire linked list to find its length.
- getRandom: O(k), where k is the randomly generated index. In the worst case, this involves traversing k nodes in the linked list.

**Space Complexity:**
- O(1) as there is no additional space used except for a constant amount of space to store variables like `length`, `start`, and `curr`.

**Second solution**

**Intuition:**
The aim of this solution is to create an object that efficiently returns a random value from a given linked list. The random value is uniformly selected from the elements of the linked list.

**Approach:**
1. In the constructor (`Solution`), iterate through the linked list to populate a vector (`num`) with the values of the linked list.
2. In the `getRandom` function, generate a random index using `rand()` and calculate the index within the range [0, size of the vector - 1].
3. Return the value at the randomly generated index in the vector.

**Time Complexity:**
- Constructor: O(n), where n is the length of the linked list. This is because the constructor iterates through the entire linked list to populate the vector.
- getRandom: O(1), as vector access and size calculation are constant time operations.

**Space Complexity:**
- O(n), where n is the length of the linked list. This is because the solution uses additional space to store the values of the linked list in the vector.
