### Intuition:
Given an integer array arr, return true if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return false.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The algorithm iterates through the list once, so the time complexity is O(n)
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(1)
