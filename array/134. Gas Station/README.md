**Intuition:**
The problem requires finding the starting gas station from where one can travel around the circuit without running out of gas. If the total sum of gas is less than the total sum of cost, then it's impossible to complete the circuit.

**Approach:**
1. First, we calculate the total gas and total cost for all stations. If total gas is less than total cost, we return -1 because it's impossible to complete the circuit.
2. If the total gas is sufficient, we iterate through each station. At each station, we calculate the difference between gas and cost (i.e., gas[i] - cost[i]), which indicates the net gain or loss of gas if we start from this station.
3. We maintain a running total (`total`) and initialize `ans` to store the potential starting station index. If at any station `i`, `total` becomes negative, it means we cannot reach the next station from the current station without gas. So, we update `ans` to the next station (`i+1`) and reset `total` to 0.
4. After iterating through all stations, `ans` will store the starting index if it's possible to complete the circuit; otherwise, it will be 0.

**Space Complexity:**  
The space complexity is O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

**Time Complexity:**  
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of gas stations. We iterate through the gas stations twice - once to calculate the total gas and cost, and once to find the starting station. Both iterations are linear, so the overall time complexity is linear in the number of gas stations.
