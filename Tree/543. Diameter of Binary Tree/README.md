### Intuition
The problem is to find the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The key observation is that for each node, the longest path through that node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees. Therefore, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) to compute the height of each subtree and simultaneously update the maximum diameter found.

### Method
1. **Initialization**: Start by defining a class `Solution` with an initializer that sets an instance variable `Maxi` to 0. This variable will store the maximum diameter found.
2. **Height Calculation**:
   - The `height` method computes the height of the tree rooted at a given node.
   - If the node is `None`, return 0.
   - If the node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), return 1.
   - Recursively compute the height of the left and right subtrees.
   - Update `Maxi` with the maximum value between its current value and the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.
   - Return the height of the tree rooted at the current node, which is `1 + max(left, right)`.
3. **Diameter Calculation**:
   - The `diameterOfBinaryTree` method invokes the `height` method on the root to start the DFS.
   - It returns the value of `Maxi`, which contains the diameter of the tree.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used during the DFS. In the worst case, the height of the tree could be n (in a completely unbalanced tree), resulting in O(n) space complexity.
