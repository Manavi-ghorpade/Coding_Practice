### Intuition

The goal is to transform a given binary tree into a "flattened" linked list in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree. The transformation should be done in-place, meaning no additional data structures should be used to store nodes.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS):** We use a helper function `dfs` that recursively processes each node.
2. **Post-order Processing:** For each node, we first process its left and right children before rearranging the current node. This is a post-order traversal approach.
3. **Flattening Left Subtree:** If a node has a left subtree, we flatten the left subtree and attach it to the right of the current node. The original right subtree is then attached to the end of this newly attached subtree.
4. **Returning the Tail:** The `dfs` function returns the last node (tail) of the flattened subtree so that it can be connected properly to the parent node's right subtree.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the traversal, and each operation (relinking nodes) is done in constant time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the height \(h\) can be equal to \(n\), making the space complexity \(O(n)\). For a balanced tree, the height would be \(O(\log n)\).

### Summary

- **Intuition:** Use DFS to flatten the tree in post-order.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to recursion stack space.
