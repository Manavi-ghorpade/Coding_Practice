Sure! Here's the explanation for the solution, along with the intuition, and analysis of time and space complexity.

### Intuition

The problem is about constructing a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversals. The key intuition here is understanding how these two traversal methods relate to the structure of the tree:
- **Preorder traversal** visits nodes in the order: root -> left subtree -> right subtree.
- **Inorder traversal** visits nodes in the order: left subtree -> root -> right subtree.

From this, we can infer:
1. The first element in the `preorder` list is always the root of the tree or subtree.
2. The position of this root element in the `inorder` list divides the list into the left and right subtrees.

Using this information, we can recursively build the tree:
- Find the root from the `preorder` list.
- Locate the root in the `inorder` list to divide it into left and right subtrees.
- Recursively repeat the process for each subtree.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm can be analyzed as follows:
- The main operation inside the recursion is finding the index of the root element in the `inorder` list, which takes O(n) time in the worst case.
- Since this operation is performed for each element in the `preorder` list exactly once, and there are `n` elements, the total time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case.

However, if we use a hashmap to store the indices of elements in the `inorder` list, we can reduce the time complexity of finding the root index to O(1). This brings the total time complexity to O(n).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity includes the space for the recursion stack and the space required to store the tree:
- The recursion stack space is O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case of an unbalanced tree, this can be O(n). In the best case of a balanced tree, this is O(log n).
- The space required to store the constructed tree is O(n).

So, the overall space complexity is O(n).

Here's the annotated code:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Base case: if the lists are empty, return None
        if not preorder or not inorder:
            return None

        # The first element in the preorder list is the root
        root_val = preorder[0]
        root = TreeNode(root_val)

        # Find the index of the root in the inorder list
        mid = inorder.index(root_val)

        # Recursively build the left subtree
        root.left = self.buildTree(preorder[1:mid+1], inorder[:mid])

        # Recursively build the right subtree
        root.right = self.buildTree(preorder[mid+1:], inorder[mid+1:])

        return root

# Intuition:
# The preorder list gives the root node.
# The inorder list helps us to identify the left and right subtrees.
# Using recursion, we can repeat this process for each subtree.
```

### Summary
- **Intuition:** Use preorder to get the root and inorder to divide left and right subtrees.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) without optimization, O(n) with a hashmap.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n).
