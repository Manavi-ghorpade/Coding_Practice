### Intuition
To count the number of nodes in a complete binary tree efficiently, we can utilize the properties of the tree's height. In a complete binary tree:
- If the leftmost and rightmost paths from the root to the leaf have the same height, the tree is a perfect binary tree, and the number of nodes can be calculated using the formula \(2^{height} - 1\).
- If the heights are different, we need to recursively count the nodes in the left and right subtrees.

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Height**:
   - Create helper functions to calculate the height of the leftmost path (`leftheight`) and the rightmost path (`rightheight`) from the current node.
   - If the node is `None`, return 0.
   - Otherwise, recursively calculate the height by adding 1 to the height of the left or right child.

2. **Count Nodes**:
   - If the root is `None`, return 0.
   - Calculate the left and right heights of the tree.
   - If the heights are equal, the tree is a perfect binary tree, and the number of nodes is \(2^{height} - 1\).
   - If the heights are not equal, recursively count the nodes in the left and right subtrees, and add 1 for the current root node.

### Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O((log n)^2)\)
  - Calculating the height of the tree takes \(O(log n)\) time.
  - At each node, we are calculating the height for its left and right subtrees, leading to a recursive depth of \(log n\).
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O((log n)^2)\).

- **Space complexity**: \(O(log n)\)
  - The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack depth, which is the height of the tree. For a complete binary tree, the height is \(O(log n)\).
