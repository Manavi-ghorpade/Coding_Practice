**Intuition:**
The problem requires implementing a circular deque (double-ended queue), a data structure that supports inserting and deleting elements from both the front and the back of the queue. The circular nature of the deque means that the front and back elements are connected, forming a circle.

**Approach:**
- We'll implement the circular deque using a doubly linked list where each node contains a value and pointers to the next and previous nodes.
- We maintain a dummy node to simplify insertion and deletion at the front and back of the deque.
- To handle the circular aspect, we keep track of the last pointer, which points to the last node in the deque. When inserting or deleting elements, we update this pointer accordingly.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity of this implementation depends on the number of elements stored in the deque. Since we're using a doubly linked list to represent the deque, the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the deque.

**Time Complexity:**
- Inserting and deleting elements at both the front and the back of the deque have a time complexity of O(1), as they involve only pointer manipulations and constant-time operations.
- Similarly, accessing the front and rear elements, checking if the deque is empty or full, all have time complexity of O(1), as they involve simple pointer dereferencing or comparisons.
- Overall, the time complexity for all operations is O(1), making this implementation efficient for a circular deque.
