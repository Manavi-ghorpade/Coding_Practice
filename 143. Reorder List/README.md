**Intuition:**
The goal is to reorder a linked list such that the resulting list has the first element, the last element, the second element, the second-to-last element, and so on. The intuition is to find the middle of the linked list, reverse the second half, and then merge the two halves by interleaving their nodes.

**Approach:**
1. Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to find the middle of the linked list. Break the list at the middle to create two separate lists.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list. This involves iterating through the second half and reversing the direction of the links between nodes.
3. Merge the two halves by interleaving their nodes. Iterate through both halves, connecting nodes alternately.
4. The reordered list is obtained.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. The algorithm involves three passes through the linked list: finding the middle, reversing the second half, and merging the two halves.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The reversal of the second half is done in place without using additional space proportional to the input size.
