**Intuition:**
Given a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in ascending order and the first element of each row is greater than the last element of the previous row, we need to determine whether a target element exists in the matrix.

**Approach:**
1. We perform a binary search twice:
   - First, to find the appropriate row where the target might exist. We compare the target with the first and last element of each row.
   - Second, within the found row, we perform binary search to find the target element.

2. In the first binary search:
   - If the target is less than the first element of a row, we narrow our search to the upper half.
   - If the target is greater than the last element of a row, we narrow our search to the lower half.
   - If the target falls within the range of a row, we have found our row.

3. In the second binary search within the found row:
   - We search for the target element within that row.
   - If the target is less than the middle element, we narrow our search to the left half.
   - If the target is greater than the middle element, we narrow our search to the right half.
   - If we find the target, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

**Time Complexity:**
- Binary search is performed twice.
- The first binary search has a time complexity of O(log(m)), where m is the number of rows.
- The second binary search has a time complexity of O(log(n)), where n is the number of columns.
- So, the overall time complexity is O(log(m) + log(n)).

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(1) because we are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables.
