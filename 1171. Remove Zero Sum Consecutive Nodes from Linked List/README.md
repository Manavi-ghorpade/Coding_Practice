**Intuition:**
The problem requires removing consecutive sequences of nodes in a linked list whose values sum up to zero. We can achieve this efficiently by using a hash map to store the running sum of nodes encountered so far. If the same sum appears again, it means the nodes between the two occurrences sum up to zero, hence can be removed.

**Approach:**
1. We traverse the linked list once to calculate the running sum of nodes encountered so far. We store each sum along with its corresponding node in a hash map.
2. Then, we traverse the linked list again. While traversing, for each node, we check if the running sum from the beginning of the list up to the current node has been encountered before.
3. If the sum has been encountered before, it means there is a sequence of nodes whose values sum up to zero. We update the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip these nodes.
4. Finally, we return the modified linked list.

**Space Complexity:**  
- We use an unordered map to store the running sum along with its corresponding node. In the worst case, the map could store all the nodes, leading to a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

**Time Complexity:**  
- The algorithm traverses the linked list twice, once to calculate the running sum and once to remove zero-sum sequences. Both traversals have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
