**Intuition:**
The goal is to check if a given linked list is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards as backward. The intuition here is to find the middle of the linked list, reverse the second half, and then compare the reversed second half with the first half to check for palindrome property.

**Approach:**
1. Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the middle.
3. Compare the reversed second half with the first half for palindrome check.
4. If the values in corresponding nodes don't match at any point, the list is not a palindrome.
5. If all values match, the list is a palindrome.

**Time Complexity:**
The algorithm involves three main steps:
   - Finding the middle: O(N/2), where N is the number of nodes in the list.
   - Reversing the second half: O(N/2).
   - Comparing the two halves: O(N/2).
   
   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N).

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The reversal is done in-place without using additional space proportional to the input size.
