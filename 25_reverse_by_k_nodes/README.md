**Intuition:**
- The idea is to reverse groups of k nodes at a time in the linked list.
- The process involves reversing the current group, connecting it to the previous group, and moving to the next group.

**Approach:**
1. Initialize a dummy node to simplify edge case handling.
2. Use a while loop to iterate through the linked list.
3. Inside the loop, use the `getKth` function to find the kth node from the current position.
4. If the kth node is null, there are no more groups of size k, so break the loop.
5. Save the next node after the current group (`groupnext`).
6. Reverse the current group of size k.
7. Connect the reversed group to the previous group.
8. Move the pointer to the next group.
9. Return the head of the modified linked list.

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because every node is visited once.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
